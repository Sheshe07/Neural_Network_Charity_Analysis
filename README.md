# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Deliverable 4:
## Overview of the analysis:
Because of my previous practice, and kwowledge of machine learning and neural network I was asked to help my co-worker Beks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. For this project we was provided with a dataset that contained various measures on 34,000 different organizations, that was previously funded by Alphabet Soup. For our analysis we used Alphabet Soup Charity dataset (charity_data.csv) I then broke it down to 3 steps on how I will achieve the resualts.

## Data Preprocessing
- Complie, Train and Evaluate the Model
- Preprocessing the data for the neural network
- Optimizing the model

## Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model

I had to hidden layers. One had 8 neurons and the other one had 5.

Based on my anaylsis the model was not able to achieve the taget performance.

268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.6893 - accuracy: 0.5475
Loss: 0.6893354058265686, Accuracy: 0.5475218892097473

After anaylizing the model I've came to realize that it couldn't reach the score that was requested. After many filed attempt we left with the mid score of 55% accuracy.
