# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Deliverable 4:
## Overview of the analysis:
Because of my previous practice, and kwowledge of machine learning and neural network I was asked to help my co-worker Beks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. For this project we was provided with a dataset that contained various measures on 34,000 different organizations, that was previously funded by Alphabet Soup. For our analysis we used Alphabet Soup Charity dataset (charity_data.csv) I then broke it down to 3 steps on how I will achieve the resualts.
